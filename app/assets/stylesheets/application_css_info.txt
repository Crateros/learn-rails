	The app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss file serves two purposes.
    First, you can add any CSS rules to the file that you want to use anywhere on
    your website. Second, the file serves as a manifest, providing a list of files that
    should be concatenated and included in the single CSS file that is delivered to
    the browser

    	You could use this file for any style rules that are used on every page, particularly simple utility rules such

    as highlighting or resetting the appearance of links. However, in practice, you
    are more likely to modify the style rules provided by Zurb Foundation. These
    modifications don’t belong in the app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss
    file; they will go in the app/assets/stylesheets/1st_load_framework.css.scss
    file.
    
    	In general, it’s bad practice to place a lot of CSS in the app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss
    file (unless your CSS is very limited). Instead, structure your CSS in multiple
    files. CSS that is used on only a single page can go in a file with a name
    that matches the page. Or, if sections of the website share common elements,
    such as themes for landing pages or administrative pages, make a file for each
    theme.
